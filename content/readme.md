Hi, my name is Jesse Janzer and I am a software developer currently working at [Tafi](https://maketafi.com) as the VP of Engineering.

I write software for a living and have been doing it professionally since 2002. I've worked on a variety of systems and technologies including PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, R, Java, Objective-C, Swift, C#, C, C++, GLSL/HLSL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and others. I have built websites, SAAS, embedded software, mobile apps, 3D tools, VR, pipelines, and many other systems. I ran a freelance software company called Tindr fulltime for a number of years. Now I work in 3D and machine learning. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I'm currently working towards a Masters.

I occasionally work on open source software on [github](https://github.com/jjanzer). I opensourced our previous [MCS](https://github.com/mcs-sdk/mcs) product and lead the creation of the [Daz to Unity Bridge](https://www.daz3d.com/daz-to-unity-bridge).

I also occasionally post on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBljercTqd_fWrKzN1mGFQ).
