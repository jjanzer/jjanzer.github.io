<li>Use clonezilla but don&rsquo;t proportionally copy, do a 1-for-1 disk to disk copy</li>
<li>Use gparted to move the partitions to the very end of the disk that follow after your <code>C</code> drive</li>
<li>Boot into windows and use the disk management utility to expand the <code>C</code> drive</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>I recently needed to migrate a drive from a 512GB SSD running windows 10 to a larger 2TB drive. I&rsquo;ve done this in the past plenty of times with Clonezilla but I ran into a problem this time.</p>
<p>I did a proportional clone for a disk-to-disk with Clonezilla but windows failed to boot properly. I ended up getting getting into a blue screen during the boot process that had the error code <code>0xc0000225</code> and <code>unable to find the file windows\system32\winload.exe</code>. I created a windows 10 installation thumb drive and attempted to recover the new drive. I tried all the various bootrec tools to no avail. I verified that I cloned from a MBR to MBR and not GPT. I also tried one more time and it still failed.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-tried-that-didnt-work">What I tried that didn&rsquo;t work</h2>
<ol>
<li>I removed the old drive so it wasn&rsquo;t interferring</li>
<li>I physically moved the sata connections around</li>
<li>I made sure the new drive was in the first boot slot in the bios</li>
<li>I tried using bootrec, diskpart, bcdedit,</li>
<li>I tried cloning again</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I then tried cloning in Clonezilla <strong>without a proportional copy</strong>. This time it worked and I was able to boot sucessfully. Since the boot drive now worked I wanted to expand the <code>C</code> volume but I couldn&rsquo;t because the default windows installation has either has 3 or 4 partions with the <code>C</code> drive sandwiched between. So I installed gparted on a thumb drive and moved the recovery partition, which was the partition after the <code>C</code> partition, to the end of the disk. This worked well and went very fast. I then booted back into windows and use the disk utilties there to expand the <code>C</code> volume.</p>
