<p>Hi, my name is Jesse Janzer and I am a software developer currently working at <a href="https://maketafi.com">Tafi</a> as the VP of Engineering.</p>
<p>I write software for a living and have been doing it professionally since 2002. I&rsquo;ve worked on a variety of systems and technologies including PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, R, Java, Objective-C, Swift, C#, C, C++, GLSL/HLSL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and others. I have built websites, SAAS, embedded software, mobile apps, 3D tools, VR, pipelines, and many other systems. I ran a freelance software company called Tindr fulltime for a number of years. Now I work in 3D and machine learning. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I&rsquo;m currently working towards a Masters.</p>
<p>I occasionally work on open source software on <a href="https://github.com/jjanzer">github</a>. I opensourced our previous <a href="https://github.com/mcs-sdk/mcs">MCS</a> product and lead the creation of the <a href="https://www.daz3d.com/daz-to-unity-bridge">Daz to Unity Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>I also occasionally post on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBljercTqd_fWrKzN1mGFQ">youtube</a>.</p>
